Multicipher plugin for KeePass 2.x
****************************************

First of all, I would not be writing this plugin had here been no KeePass, so congratulations and kudos to Dominik Reichl for coming up with this incredible open source password management tool.

The aim of this version of the plugin is to provide dual layer of protection, I am no security expert so I chose to follow one of the method outlined by Bruce Schneier in his book "Applied Cryptography".
